// Exercise 2: Fibonacci Sequence
// Write a recursive function fibonacci(n) that takes a positive integer n as an argument and returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

// Exercise 3: Power
// Write a recursive function power(base, exponent) that takes a base and an exponent as arguments and returns the result of raising the base to the power of exponent.

// Exercise 4: Sum of Array Elements
// Write a recursive function sumArray(arr) that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all elements in the array.

// Exercise 5: Recursive Range
// Write a recursive function recursiveRange(n) that takes a positive integer n as an argument and returns the sum of all positive integers from 1 to n.

// Exercise 6: Recursive Length
// Write a recursive function recursiveLength(str) that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of characters in the string.

// Exercise 7: Recursive Reverse
// Write a recursive function recursiveReverse(str) that takes a string as an argument and returns the reversed version of the string.

// Exercise 8: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
// Write a recursive function gcd(a, b) that takes two positive integers a and b as arguments and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).

// Exercise 9: Flatten Array
// Write a recursive function flattenArray(arr) that takes a nested array as an argument and returns a flat array with all the elements.

// Remember, recursion requires a base case to stop the recursion. Encourage students to think carefully about the base case and how the function calls itself with smaller inputs to reach the base case.
